            <p>Hello, my name is David, and I'm an aspiring web developer. I was always fascinated with coding and computer science, and for that reason 
                I never stopped improving and expanding my skillset. Over the last few years I've been focusing full time on JavaScript and everything
                related to it. I now have accumulated advanced knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, JSON, Unity, and many more, with my 
                skills improving with each day. I hope to become a full-stack developer to be able to make my vision reality, through coding.</p>
